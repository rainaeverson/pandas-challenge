    "## Summary of the Shool Data\n",
    "##### Two datasets have been combined to allow for analysis between student success and school information. The Schools dataset includes basic information about various schools such as type, budget, and size. The Students dataset holds basic information about student information and performace, including student names, school names, current grade level, and test scores for math and reading. After merging these datasets, various information has been filtered and calculated to glean conclusions about student performance.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluating the combined datasets reveals a few notable conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- From the School Type Summary, it is clear that Charter schools have more success with the overall passing rates of their students. Given that the Charter Schools populations range over the entire population count parameters, this is a definitive marker of success for the entire student population.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Schools that have a population under 2000 have a noticable difference in success(taken from the Size Summary table). Greater populace schools suffered in average math scores and overall passing rate. The only outlier within the large school category, with high grades throughout all of the categories is Wilson High School, which is a Charter School. Reinforcing the previous conclusion about Charter School success.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The schools classified as large had the highest per-student expenditure, which makes it appear that budget does not create more success among students. In fact, the schools with the lowest budgets had the most success for test scores and passing rates. From the School Spending Summary, it may be surmised that the greater the budget, the lower the scores and passing rates. Without knowing where the budget is going, we cannot conclude that schools should get less money, as the schools with lower budgets may be prioritizing equipment and learning opportunities that are simply more effective. Another school with a higher budget may be spending toward materials that are not condusive to an enriching learning environment.\n",
